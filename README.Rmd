This READme file contains the instructions on how to build a report looking at the Census data on Alzheimer's Disease and Healthy Aging in the United States.

Use demographics.Rmd to explore the trends of Alzheimer's Disease and Dementia prevalence, demographic analysis of cognitive function, and looking at state comparisons of other aging health indicators. 

The figures.Rmd file will allow us to create tables and figures that explore the demographic data and trends.
